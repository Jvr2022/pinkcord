    <h2>About Pinkcord</h2>
    <p>Pinkcord is a computer virus written in Python that utilizes Discord bots to transmit information. Please note that this program was created solely for educational purposes, and it should not be used to engage in any illegal activities. The use of Pinkcord may have severe legal consequences, including the banning of your Discord account. Download and use this program responsibly. To put it simply, Pinkcord can be compared to meterpreter from Metasploit, only Pinkcord works outside the local network and transmits data via Discord and slightly different functions.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Install Python from the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Official Website.</a></li>
        <li>Download the files from <a href="https://github.com/xanonDev/pinkcord">Github.</a></li>
        <li>Open a command prompt on Windows or a terminal on Linux and run <code>python setup.py</code>. If that doesn't work, try <code>py setup.py</code>, or if you are on Windows, you can just click on <code>setup.bat</code>.</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions provided. If the program compiles to an exe, enable it on the computer you want to control.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Platforms</strong></p>
    <p>The program was written for Windows, so a large amount may not work on normal Linux, and even more so on Termux or Mac. It is possible that in the future, there will be an adaptation of Pinkcord to more platforms.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning</strong></p>
    <p>Please exercise caution and use this program responsibly. Remember that engaging in any illegal activities can result in serious consequences.</p>
